# mask_monitor

## Project Overview

### Objectives:
The aim of this project is to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not by capturing input from the camera and testing it on a Face Mask detection Model.  If our model detects a face without a mask, it will capture the image and store it in a database for record. After doing all this, if time permits, then the next improvement will be identifying the defaulters by using the data stored previously.
